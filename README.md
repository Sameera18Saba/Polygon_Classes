# My Python Programs

This repository contains various Python programs I’ve written while learning.  
Each file demonstrates a specific concept such as loops, functions, file handling, and OOP.

## 📂 Contents
- `loops.py` – Programs using for/while loops.
- `arrays.py` – Array operations (sum, average, duplicates, etc.).
- `file_handling.py` – Reading and writing text files.
- `classes.py` – Examples of classes, inheritance, and access modifiers.

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- (Optional) Jupyter Notebook if you want to run the `.ipynb` files.
